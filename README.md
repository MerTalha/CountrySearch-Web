# Countries and Locations Web Application

Welcome to the Countries and Locations web application! This website allows you to retrieve information about countries using REST Countries API and display them in beautifully designed cards using the Bootstrap library. You can also obtain location information by clicking on the button next to the search bar, which utilizes the OpenCageData API to automatically determine the country based on the coordinates.

## Features

- Search: Enter the name of a country in the search bar, and the application will retrieve its information from the REST Countries API. The country's details, such as population, capital, currency, and more, will be displayed in a visually appealing card.
- Location Detection: By clicking on the button next to the search bar, the application will retrieve your current location using your device's coordinates. It then uses the OpenCageData API to automatically determine the corresponding country. The country name will be automatically populated in the search bar, allowing you to quickly search for information about that country.
- Neighboring Countries: If the searched country has neighboring countries, their flags and names will be displayed at the bottom of the page. This feature provides a convenient way to explore and learn about a country's neighboring nations.
